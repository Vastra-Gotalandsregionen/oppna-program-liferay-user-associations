= Details =

  # The Community hooks start processing when a user log into the portal. 
  # The hook works through all of the matchers one at a time. A matcher use a regexp as a filter to determinate if the matcher is valid for the user. On a match, the hook analyses if the user is a member of all the groups the matcher have in it's list of groups and if not is a member, the user will be added to that group.
  # When all matchers has been processed, the hook determine the correct landing page by analyzing the groups the user is member of. 
  # And ends with setting the landing pages so the user later can be redirected there.
